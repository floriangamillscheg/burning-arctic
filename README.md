(1) Burning Arctic is a level-based adventure game offering a visceral and exciting spectacle of the serious destruction of the arctic caused by man through exploitation. The game calls attention to the need to deal with this very serious issue. The aim is to sensitize the players to the catastrophes and consequences as well as inform about different region specific animals and their current challenges regarding climate change. Therefore the player is equipped with a bunch of polar animals who need to overcome different levels of challenges while the main goal is to rescue the ice bear cub that was kidnapped by the big bad company - a drilling and exploiting invasive group of humans.
